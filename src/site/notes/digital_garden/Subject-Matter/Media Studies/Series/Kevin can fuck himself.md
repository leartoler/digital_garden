**"Kevin Can F*** Himself" is a series about how someone's mood can change depending on their relationship with others. It explores the oppression of one man but also the ease of taking control. If Kevin is a bad person, the protagonist, in her desperation, is even worseâ€”she manipulates her only friend and does not confront her husband directly.

Yes, the series has a feminist discourse, but I think it is somewhat superficial.

However, the series also has great artistic direction, which is evident in the contrast between the serious moments and the sitcom-style scenes. This artistic direction is also reflected in the narrative tone. In terms of both storytelling and aesthetics, the series delivers a strong performance.
